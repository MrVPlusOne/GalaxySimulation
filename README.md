# Galaxy Simulation

#### A demonstration of Barnesâ€“Hut's algorithm for n-body simulations

#### Main features:

* A flexible displaying system: watch the simulation result as an animation, and you can move the viewport by dragging your mouse, zoom in or out by scrolling middle button.
* A 'show grids' mode, in which you can see the inner data structure (red grids) the algorithm is using, during the simulation.
* Clicking any dot will displaying the approximation used (green grids) to calculate the total force exerted on it.


* Multi-threading support and calculating on the fly. You don't need to wait until all the calculation has been finished to watch the result.
